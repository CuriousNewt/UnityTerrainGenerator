# Unity Terrain Generator

Procedural terrain generation in Unity.

# Modes

Generates terrains based on Mesh or Unity's Terrain. Height map and color map can be generated as 2D textures, too.

# Issues

There's something off with the height (color) map displaying (in all modes) and translating it into terrains and Unity's Terrain based generation seems to be way more complex than I previously thought, so it's still not completely implemented yet.
